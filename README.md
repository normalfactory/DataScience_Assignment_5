## Analysis: Potential Treatments to Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The analysis animal study on the treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) with various drug tream has been completed.  The work that generated the charts used in the analysis is located within the Pymaceutical_Analysis.ipynb.  There are three observable trends based on the analysis.  
  
###### 1 Capomulin Reduced tumor size
The mice that had the drug treatment of Capomulin had the greatest overall reduction in the tumor volume. The start of the study period, the tumor size was 45 mm3 and at the end of the 45 day treatment size had been reduced to 36.2 mm3 (Figure 1).
  
###### 2 Capomulin Lowest Metastatic Spread
The mice that had the drug treatment of Capomulin had the lowest metastatic spread during the treatment (Figure 2).

###### 3 Capomulin Highest Survival 
The mice that had the drug treatment of Capomulin had the highest survival during the 45 day treatment with an 84% survival rate (Figure 3).
